   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (if there are any):

   Note: Currently, there are no specific dependencies listed in the `package-lock.json` file.

## Usage
Once the project is installed, you can start using it. Start the application using the following command:

user-workspace/
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── (other project files)
```

- `package-lock.json`: Locks the versions of dependencies for consistent installs.
